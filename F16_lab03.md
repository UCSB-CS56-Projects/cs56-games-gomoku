(a) Two player game where to win you need to place five of your own markers in a row. Players take turns placing markers down one at a time.

(b) As a player, I can put down a marker so work towards winning the game.
As a player, if I put down five markers, the game tells me that I won.
As a competitor to player one, I can do everything player one can do so that I can beat him or her.

(c) The software runs but is not very forgiving to errors in user input. The game starts immediately and can be played, but will not end. Winning does not print anything in the GUI, but repeatedly announces that the player won in the terminal.

(d) As a player, I want a homescreen that describes instructions and includes a start button so that I can navigate easily.
As a user, some documentation of the game so that I know how to play and how classes are setup so that I can have some starting knowledge of the program and its bugs.
As a player, I want the game to end properly when somebody wins so that it plays out like any other game that has an actual ending.

(e) There is nothing in the README.md other than a statement claiming that a new version has better MVC separation. However, this claim is a lie. The issues list still has MVC separation open as a feature to be fixed.

(f) The build.xml file appears to be in relatively good shape and more fleshed out than other parts of the project. The targets have descriptions and seem to work as expected. There is still an older version of the game that on the surface does not seem any different than the current version. We will look at both versions and decide on which to build off of.

(g) There are seven issues, totaling about 1150 points. There are other bugs in the program that are not listed as issues, as well. The issues that are listed are clear and sensible.

(h) Issues:
* [Fixing the output](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-gomoku/issues/13) that occurs in the terminal when someone wins, and announce winner via GUI.
* [Create computer player](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-gomoku/issues/14) that plays against the user so that a single player is able to play.
* [Add JUnit tests](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-gomoku/issues/15) to ensure the game runs smoothly and does not break while playing.

(i) The code is divided into four files: Viewer, Controller, Gomoku, and GomokuOrig. Gomoku contains most of the classes and code that runs the game. GomokuOrig is a fully self-contained program, whereas the other 3 files work together. GomokuOrig appears to be older version of the game that was made before the game was split up into separate classes. The methods to detect a 5-in-a-row seem very thorough and work consistently when we play the game. There is one particularly clever method that flips the board to reduce the number of methods required to check for a 5-in-a-row. The class layout is okay but could definitely be improved once we learn more about design patterns. The existing methods are very clear and the code on the whole is commented thoughtfully. It did not take us long to get a good idea of how the code works. The game itself has a lot of work to be done, but the work put into so far is well done, just incomplete.

(j) There is no test coverage so far, but we see a lot of opportunities to add plenty of tests. There are no JUnit tests. We assume the testing done previously was done simply by playing the game and looking for unexpected behavior while playing. We will create test cases to force coordinates of markers to test simple games, games where invalid marker placements are requested, etc. to ensure that, with our code, we do not break any existing behavior.
